\title{Get a PROJ.4 character string}
\usage{
get_proj4(x, as.CRS = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a projection. One of:
\enumerate{
   \item{a \code{PROJ.4} character string}
   \item{a \code{\link[sp:CRS]{CRS}} object}
   \item{an EPSG code}
   \item{one the following shortcuts codes:
     \describe{
       \item{\code{"longlat"}}{Not really a projection, but a plot of the longitude-latitude coordinates (WGS84 datum).}
       \item{\code{"wintri"}}{Winkel Tripel (1921). Popular projection that is useful in world maps. It is the standard of world maps made by the National Geographic Society. Type: compromise}
       \item{\code{"robin"}}{Robinson (1963). Another popular projection for world maps. Type: compromise}
       \item{\code{"eck4"}}{Eckert IV (1906). Projection useful for world maps. Area sizes are preserved, which makes it particularly useful for truthful choropleths. Type: equal-area}
       \item{\code{"hd"}}{Hobo-Dyer (2002). Another projection useful for world maps in which area sizes are preserved. Type: equal-area}
       \item{\code{"gall"}}{Gall (Peters) (1855). Another projection useful for world maps in which area sizes are preserved. Type: equal-area}
       \item{\code{"merc"}}{Web Mercator. Projection in which shapes are locally preserved, a variant of the original Mercator (1569), used by Google Maps, Bing Maps, and OpenStreetMap. Areas close to the poles are inflated. Type: conformal}
       \item{\code{"utmXX(s)"}}{Universal Transverse Mercator. Set of 60 projections where each projection is a traverse mercator optimized for a 6 degree longitude range. These ranges are called UTM zones. Zone \code{01} covers -180 to -174 degrees (West) and zone \code{60} 174 to 180 east. Replace XX in the character string with the zone number. For southern hemisphere, add \code{"s"}. So, for instance, the Netherlands is \code{"utm31"} and New Zealand is \code{"utm59s"}}
       \item{\code{"mill"}}{Miller (1942). Projetion based on Mercator, in which poles are displayed. Type: compromise}
       \item{\code{"eqc0"}}{Equirectangular (120). Projection in which distances along meridians are conserved. The equator is the standard parallel. Also known as Plate Carr\'ee. Type: equidistant}
       \item{\code{"eqc30"}}{Equirectangular (120). Projection in which distances along meridians are conserved. The latitude of 30 is the standard parallel. Type: equidistant}
       \item{\code{"eqc45"}}{Equirectangular (120). Projection in which distances along meridians are conserved. The latitude of 45 is the standard parallel. Also known as Gall isographic. Type: equidistant}
       \item{\code{"laea_Eur"}}{European Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area Projection. Similar to EPSG code 3035.}
       \item{\code{"laea_NA"}}{North American Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area Projection. Known as SR-ORG:7314.}
       \item{\code{"rd"}}{Rijksdriehoekstelsel. Triangulation coordinate system used in the Netherlands.}

\item{as.CRS}{should a CRS object be returned instead of a PROJ.4 character string? Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
validated PROJ.4 character string, or, if \code{as.CRS=TRUE} a \code{\link[sp:CRS]{CRS}} object.
}
\description{
Get full PROJ.4 string from an existing PROJ.4 string, a shortcut, or a \code{\link[sp:CRS]{CRS}} object.
